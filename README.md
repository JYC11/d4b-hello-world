# Django For Beginners Chapter 1~2: Hello World

In this chapter I learn how to set up virtual environments and using the CLI to create django projects and apps.

"django admin startproject {YOUR-PROJECT-NAME}" to start a project.

"python manage.py startapp {SOME-APP}" to make an app within a project to be used. Apps are basically packages that can be imported and used.

"python manage.py runserver" to run the server in the local machine.

Very simple so far not much going on.
